# Identifying BOF

There are three primary techniques for identifying flaws in applications:

1. Source code review (if it's available).
2. Reverse engineering.
3. Fuzzing.

### Fuzzing

> Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.

**Remember:** Fuzz every input field in the application hoping for unexpected behaviour or app crash.

**Fuzzing HTTP Protocol**

First of all we need to collect the network protocol information passed to the server by using Burpsuite. This means, headers + POST data. Once collected, we can replicate this connection multiple times (fuzzing) with a python script.

Before running the fuzzer script, we need to attach a debugger to the application while it's running to catch any potential access violation. In this case, we must first find which process of the many that the app is running is listening on TCP port 80 (using TCPView).

Once found, we have to execute Inmunity debugger with system privileges and open it with File > Attach. After attaching the app, the debugger stops it, so we need to resume execution (F9).

Voilà. Wait for crashes!
