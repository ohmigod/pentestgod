# Service Exploits

If vulnerable services are running as root, exploiting them can lead to privilege escalation.

Show all processes running as root:

```bash
ps aux | grep "^root"
```

With any result, try to identify the version number and matching exploits on searchsploit, google or github.

```bash
$programname -v
$programname --version

#Show installed programs on Debian distrubutions:
dpkg -l | grep $programname

#Show installed programs on systems that use RPM:
rpm -qa | grep $programname
```

#### Port forwarding

If there is a service listening only on localhost and there is no way to execute an exploit on the machine use port forwarding.

```bash
netstat -antup
```
