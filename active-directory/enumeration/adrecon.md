# ADRecon

> ADRecon is a tool which extracts and combines various artefacts (as highlighted below) out of an AD environment. The information can be presented in a specially formatted Microsoft Excel report that includes summary views with metrics to facilitate analysis and provide a holistic picture of the current state of the target AD environment.

* Forest;
* Domain;
* Trusts;
* Sites;
* Subnets;
* Schema History;
* Default and Fine Grained Password Policy (if implemented);
* Domain Controllers, SMB versions, whether SMB Signing is supported and FSMO roles;
* Users and their attributes;
* Service Principal Names (SPNs);
* Groups, memberships and changes;
* Organizational Units (OUs);
* GroupPolicy objects and gPLink details;
* DNS Zones and Records;
* Printers;
* Computers and their attributes;
* PasswordAttributes (Experimental);
* LAPS passwords (if implemented);
* BitLocker Recovery Keys (if implemented);
* ACLs (DACLs and SACLs) for the Domain, OUs, Root Containers, GPO, Users, Computers and Groups objects (not included in the default collection method);
* GPOReport (requires RSAT);
