# Windows Auto-Enumeration

Since manually checking everything can be very time-consuming we can use various scripts to automate the process.

## [Windows Privesc Check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check)

Windows-privesc-check is standalone executable that runs on Windows systems. It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).

## WinPEAS

One of the most powerful tool that not only actively hunts for privilege escalation misconfigurations, but highlights them for the user in the result.

Before running WinPeas add the following registry key (to output the color):

```
