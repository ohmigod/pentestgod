# Password Cracking

> Process of recovering clear text passwords.

## JTR

> CPU cracker.

### Basic usage:

In order to crack passwords with JTR we should create a txt file containing the hashes. Once done, execute the following command:

```bash
john --wordlist=$WORDLIST $HASHFILE.txt --format=$FORMAT
```

### Linux-based hashes

We know moder linux stores users and password on diferent files (passwd and shadow). In order to crack the we need to "unshadow" both files into a new one and then crack the new file:

```bash
unshadow $PASSWDFILE.txt $SHADOWFILE.txt > unshadow.txt

john --wordlist=$WORDLIST unshadow.txt
```

## Hashcat

> Hashcat is a GPU-Cracking tool which takes advantage of both CPU and GPU (faster than JTR).

```bash
hashcat -m $MODE -o $OUTPUT_FILE.cracked -a 3 -1 ?l?u?d?s $HASH_FILES ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1
```
